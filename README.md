# Lingonomicon-OOP2-Final-project-
A language-learning game that uses a localhost database

Made with Unity 6



***WARNING: THIS GAME WILL NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT A DATABASE HOSTED PROPERLY***

A copy of the current database that was in use during development will be provided in .sql format

This will need to be properly set up via a locally hosted database (like by using XAMPP and importing the .sql file there)

Please have the database properly set up before editing or running the game.
